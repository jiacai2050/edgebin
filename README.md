Edgebin is a minimalist HTTP service designed to test your networking stack, with a focus on edge deployment.

Inspired by the [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org), it leverages the power of edge computing (Cloudflare Workers) to deliver fast, reliable testing capabilities tailored for modern distributed networks.

## Features

Supports most of the endpoints from the original [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org), including:

- HTTP methods
- Authentication
- Request inspection
- Response inspection
- Dynamic data
- Status codes
- Redirects
- Cookies
- Cache
- Anything

All endpoints accept any HTTP method. Additionally, it includes features not found in the original httpbin:

- IP Geolocation:

  ```bash
  curl https://edgebin.liujiacai.net/ip
  ```

  Output:

  ```json
  {
    "origin": "2408:8240:e10:947c:2806:6bb2:c222:343c",
    "continent": "AS",
    "latitude": "30.29365",
    "longitude": "120.16142",
    "country": "CN",
    "region": "Zhejiang",
    "regionCode": "ZJ",
    "city": "Hangzhou",
    "postalCode": "310000",
    "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
    "asn": 4837,
    "asOrganization": "China Unicom",
    "colo": "LAX"
  }
  ```

- WebSocket Echo:

  This endpoint echoes back any message sent to it over a WebSocket connection. You can test it using [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat):

  ```bash
  wscat -c wss://edgebin.liujiacai.net/ws
  ```

## Deploy

Feel free to deploy your own instance of httpbin. The free tier of Cloudflare Workers is sufficient for most use cases.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/jiacai2050/edgebin)

If you'd like to share your public instance, please [let us know](https://github.com/jiacai2050/edgebin/discussions/4) and we'll add it to the list.
